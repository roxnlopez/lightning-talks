A-FRAME

A-Frame was developed to be an easy but powerfule way to develop VR content. It is based on top of HTML, so it's easy to get started. It is an open source framework that is primarily maintained by Mozilla. It has an enitty component framework, Three.js. <br>
It has compatability with most libraries and frameworks. Since it is based on HTML, it is accessible to everyone. Works on desktop and smartphones. It uses the DOM but its elements don't touch the browser layout. Updates are all done in memory under <i>requestAnimationFrame</i> call.

A-frame is mostly HTML and Javascript. Simply just enter a script tag in HTML and npm install aframe. <br>
